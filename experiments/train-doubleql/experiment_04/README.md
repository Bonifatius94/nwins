## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best exploration rates(epsilon) settings for Double-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
exploration rates lower than 5% converge very slowly.

exploration rates higher than 5% show nearly the same results for all variations. 5% reaches not the high winrates as the other ones. 10% and 20% are nearly congruent, but 20% has a little bit higher winrate.

=> optimal exploration rate is 20%
