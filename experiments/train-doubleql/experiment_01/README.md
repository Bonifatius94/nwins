## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the doubleQL is learning on SideA against a random agent and on SideB  against a random agent and if he can win against an other doubleQL agent

### Experiment Results
Winrate on SideA against a random agent raised above 97%. -> Agent is learning on SideA
Winrate on SideB against a random agent raised above 95%. -> Agent is learning on SideB
Winrate on SideA against an other doubleQLAgent raised above 99% -> Agent can beat an other doubleQL agent
