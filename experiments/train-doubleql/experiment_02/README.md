## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best learning rate settings for Double-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Learning rates higher than 10% involve too much variation and can harm the learning results.

Learning rates lower than 10% converge rather slowly.

=> optimal learning rate is 10 %
