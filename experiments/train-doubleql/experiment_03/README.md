## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best discount rates(gamma) settings for Double-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Discount rates lower than 95% involve too much variation and can harm the learning results. The winrate is also not high as the other variations.

Discount rates higher than 95% show nearly the same results for all variations. Only 95% has a better start than the other ones.

=> optimal discount rate is 95%
