## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if Sarsa Lambda learning algorithm should use linear epsilon decay or static epsilon.

### Experiment Results
Linear epsilon decays winrate is nearly the same as static epsilons winrate in the first 500.000 steps

=> but linear epsilon decay should have a higher winrate than static epsilon to justify the overhead

=> static epsilon
