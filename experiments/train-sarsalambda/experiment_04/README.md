## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best discount factor (gamma) settings for SarsaLambda learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Discount factor 99% shows too much variation, but reaches a nearly high winrate as the other ones.

Discount factors 80%, 95% and 99,9% converge rather fast. 99,9% shows the highest winrates.

=> optimal discount factor is 99,9 %
