## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best learning rate (alpha) settings for SarsaLambda learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Learning rates between 10% and 30% shows too much variation.

Learning rates 10% and lower converge rather fast. Especially 2% shows a very fast converge and not so much variation as the other learning rates.

=> optimal learning rate is 2%
