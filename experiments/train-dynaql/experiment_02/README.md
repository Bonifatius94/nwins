## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the dynaQL is learning on SideA against a random agent and on SideB  against a random agent and if he can win against an other dynaQL agent

### Experiment Results
Winrate on SideA against a random agent raised above 96%. -> Agent is learning on SideA
Winrate on SideB against a random agent raised above 94%. -> Agent is learning on SideB
Winrate on SideA against an other dynaQL raised above 99% -> Agent can beat an other dynaQL agent
