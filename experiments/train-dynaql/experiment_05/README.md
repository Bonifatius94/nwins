## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best memory size settings for Dyna-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
DynaQL with memory size 6000 and 24000 started congruent. -> No Difference
DynaQL with memory size 12000 started slower than the other ones.

=> No reliable statement over perfect memory size
