## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best learning rate settings for Dyna-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Learning rates highter than 10% involve too much variation and can harm the learning results.

Learning rates lower than 5% converge rather slowly.

=> optimal learning rate is inbetween 5 - 10 %
