## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best discount factor (gamma) settings for Dyna-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Discount factors higher than 99% and lower than 95% converge rather slowly.

Discount factors between 95% and 99% show fast convergence.

=> optimal discount factor is inbetween 95 - 99 %
