## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best minimum memory size settings for Dyna-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
All four different minimum memory sizes are nearly congruent.
Memory with min size 5000 started a little bit slower than the other ones.

=> You can select minimum memory size freely, but a lower min size shows faster good results.
