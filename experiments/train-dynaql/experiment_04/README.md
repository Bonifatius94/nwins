## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if DynaQ learning algorithm should use linear epsilon decay or static epsilon.

### Experiment Results
Linear epsilon decays winrate is below static epsilons winrate in the first 400.000 steps

=> No better start with linear epsilon decay

=> static epsilon
