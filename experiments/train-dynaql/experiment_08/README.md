## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best exploration rate(epsilon) settings for Dyna-Q learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Exploration rate below 5 % converge very slowly.
Exploration rate below 8 % is a bit faster but also slow.

Exploration rate between 8% and 20% are nearly congruent and show fast convergence.

=> optimal exploration rate is between 8 - 20 %
