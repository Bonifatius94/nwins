## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the simpleQL learned better against random or against other learning agent

### Experiment Results
WinrateA, TieRate, WinrateB
Random Trained vs Agent Trained: 24%, 21%, 55% => AgentTrained is better
Agent Trained vs Random Trained: 71%, 10, 18% => AgentTrained is better

=> Use agent trained simpleQL agent in game and versus other learning agents
