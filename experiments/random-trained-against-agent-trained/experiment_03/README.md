## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the DynaQL learned better against random or against other learning agent

### Experiment Results
WinrateA, TieRate, WinrateB
Random Trained vs Agent Trained: 66%, 17%, 17% => RandomTrained Agent is better
Agent Trained vs Random Trained: 7%, 12, 81% => RandomTrained Agent is better

=> Use random trained DynaQL agent in game and versus other learning agents
