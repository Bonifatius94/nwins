## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the SarsaLambda learned better against random or against other learning agent

### Experiment Results
WinrateA, TieRate, WinrateB
Random Trained vs Agent Trained: 14%, 69%, 11% => Agents are even
Agent Trained vs Random Trained: 81%, 8%, 11% => AgentTrained Agent is better

=> Use agent trained SarsaLambda agent in game and versus other learning agents
