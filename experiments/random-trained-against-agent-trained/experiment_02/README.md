## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the doubleQL learned better against random or against other learning agent

### Experiment Results
WinrateA, TieRate, WinrateB
Random Trained vs Agent Trained: 23%, 67%, 9% => RandomTrained Agent is better
Agent Trained vs Random Trained: 15%, 19, 65% => RandomTrained Agent is better

=> Use random trained DoubleQL agent in game and versus other learning agents
