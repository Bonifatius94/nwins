## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the doubleQL can beat the other learning agents on SideA

### Experiment Results
WinrateA, TieRate, WinrateB
VS SimpleQL: 29%, 62%, 9% => DoubleQL is better
VS DynaQL: 32%, 6, 62% => DynaQL is better
VS SarsaLambda: 65%, 23%, 12% => DoubleQL is better

=> DoubleQL won against two agents. DynaQL was better
