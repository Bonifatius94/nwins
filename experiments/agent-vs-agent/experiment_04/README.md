## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the SarsaLambda can beat the other learning agents on SideA

### Experiment Results
WinrateA, TieRate, WinrateB
VS SimpleQL: 72%, 12%, 16% => SarsaLambda is better
VS DoubleQL: 58%, 15%, 27% => SarsaLambda is better
VS DynaQL: 65%, 20%, 15% => SarsaLambda is better

=> SarsaLambda won against all three agents. It is the best agent
