## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out if the DynaQL can beat the other learning agents on SideA

### Experiment Results
WinrateA, TieRate, WinrateB
VS SimpleQL: 17%, 53%, 28% => SimpleQL is better
VS DoubleQL: 60%, 10%, 30% => DynaQL is better
VS SarsaLambda: 83%, 5%, 12% => DynaQL is better

=> DynaQL won against two agents. SimpleQL was better
