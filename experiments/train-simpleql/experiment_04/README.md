## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best exploration (epsilon) ratesettings for SimpleQ learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Exploration rate 1% shows too much variation and reaches not a high winrate.

Exploration rates between 5% and 20% converge rather fast. Especially 20% shows a very, very fast convergence.

=> optimal exploration rate is 20 %
