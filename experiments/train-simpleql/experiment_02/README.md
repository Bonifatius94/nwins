## Experiment Insights

### Experiment Purpose
Find out the best learning rate settings for SimpleQ learning algorithm.

### Experiment Results
Learning rates lower than 10% converge rather slowly.

Learning rates 10% and higher converge rather fast. Especially 20% shows a very fast converge and not so much variation as in other learning algorithms (e.g. DoubleQL)

=> optimal learning rate is 20 %
